# Gamma phase of solid oxygen (gamma-O2)
#
# Crystal structure was converted from the cif file of the entry 0015160 in the AMCSD.
# Additional reference:
# Cox D E, Samuelsen E J, Ceckurts K H
# Physical Review B7 (1973) 3102-3111
# Neutron-Diffraction determination of the crystal structure and magnetic form
# factor of gamma-oxygen
#
# The site occupancy of oxygen atom is taken into account by multiplying a factor
# of 0.25 for the number density.
#
# Since the VDOS curve of the gamma-phase of solid oxygen is not reported in the
# literature, a simplified Debye model is used instead. The Debye temperature
# Delta_D = 104 K is retrieved from the Ref:
